<b style="color:orange;">The Trivial File Transfer Protocol</b>
<p>

TFTP was first defined in 1981 by RFC 783, although the RFC does refer to an earlier
"IEN", so it is really the second definition. Currently <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1350.html">RFC 1350</a> 
is the best reference.
What is defined is a truly simple protocol for transferring files using the UDP
protocol. Studying the protocol you will learn about achieving reliability by using
a positive acknowledgement with retry scheme; and will see some of the pitfalls of
even a simple protocol. You will also learn to construct and parse databuffers that
become packets. 

<p>
<b style="color:orange;">Instructions</b>
<p><p>
Please look at the proto-<a href="http://www.cs.miami.edu/home/burt/learning/Csc524.132/workbook/mytftp.txt">man page for mytftp</a>. 
<p>
Your program should that options, and should use getopt to parse the option string.
Getopt is a standard C library call that makes command line options easy, and will 
also insure that your command line tool follows the same conventions as every other
command line tool in the unix tool set. It will implement even rules you don't know 
about!
<p>
<em>Please work in groups of two.</em> One person writes the server code and other
the client code. You might consider writing mytftp-server.c and mytftp-client.c and
finally linking them together with mytftp.c to get a combination of you and your 
partner's code
<p>
Ports 3000-3999 are open on the AWS machines. Two programs cannot bind to the 
same port, so the well known port for your tftp server must be adjustable, to avoid
other people's ports.
<p>
Make a single threaded server at first. For extra-credit make a server capable of
simultaneously handling multiple requests.

<p>
<b style="color:orange;">Steps</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>First get packets to flow, like use netbounce.
<li>Write code to construct and parse packets
<li>Get the code to step through the major motions: responding
with acks, moving to a new port number.
<li>Now open, read and write files.
<li>Add retries and test more error paths, simulating dropped, duplicated and
out of order packets.
<li>Optional: remove the single-threaded requirement.
</ol>

<p>
<b style="color:orange;">Submitting</b>
<p>
Create a proj2 directory and put your files there. There should be a Makefile and a 
mytftp product. Show your test suite with a test target in your Makefile. Your
Makefile should contain a clean target. Commit only the sources and test input files.
Do not commit binaries.
